# VisualCryptography
a short presentation for beginners in german

This is the presentation material of the basic principles of visual cryptography for about half an hour.
So far it is only available in german, an english version will follow.
The presentation itself is in the folder "Kurzvortrag". 
I recommend to demonstrate the principles with examples. There are transparencies available in the internet.
You can download and print them to demonstrate it with a projector or download an application to generate your own trancparencies of a chosen picture.
